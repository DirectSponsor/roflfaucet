# ROFLFaucet2 - Clean Layout Implementation

This is a fresh implementation of the ROFLFaucet project focusing on a clean, minimal three-column layout using flexbox strategically.

## Project Status

Starting point for rebuilding the faucet with a clean layout approach.

## Current Files

- `minimal-flexbox.html` - Working three-column layout with:
  - Clean flexbox implementation
  - Preserved browser default margins/padding
  - Collapsible sidebar functionality
  - Minimal CSS approach
  - Working slot machine demo

## Layout Approach

- **Main Layout**: Uses `display: flex` for three-column structure
- **Sidebars**: Fixed width (250px) with padding for text spacing
- **Main Content**: `flex: 1` to fill remaining space
- **Slot Machine**: Uses flexbox for horizontal reel alignment
- **Philosophy**: Only add CSS when needed, let browser defaults handle spacing

## CSS Strategy

- Minimal CSS rules - only what's actually needed
- Preserved browser default margins on headings and paragraphs
- Explicit padding where required (sidebars)
- No unnecessary containers or nesting
- Clean, readable code for maintenance

## Recent Updates

- Improved gallery image sizing for PostImg GIFs on the faucet-result page.
- Discovered postimage.cc serves low-quality previews for GIFs despite using direct URLs.
- Applied CSS to force image height to 200px to improve visibility temporarily.
- Consider replacing PostImg with a more reliable image hosting service.

## Next Steps

1. Add real content to the faucet page
2. Implement interactive slot machine functionality
3. Add responsive behavior for mobile
4. Once complete, extract to templates and includes
5. Integrate with backend faucet functionality

## Key Learnings

- Flexbox can be used strategically without losing browser defaults
- Float-based layouts are more predictable for basic structures
- Minimal CSS approach reduces debugging complexity
- Focus on one complete page before templating
