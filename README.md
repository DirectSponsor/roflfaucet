# ROFLFaucet

**A humorous Useless Token faucet system for clickforcharity.net**

## Overview

ROFLFaucet is a Useless Token faucet designed to integrate with the clickforcharity.net platform, providing users with free Useless Tokens for gamification and charity voting. The name combines "ROFL" (Rolling On the Floor Laughing) with "faucet" to emphasize the fun, community-driven nature of the platform.

### 2025 Design Philosophy
**Humor-First + Democratic Charity Allocation + Multi-Revenue Streams**
- Differentiates from boring traditional faucets with curated funny content
- Users vote with tokens on charity funding (democratic revenue allocation)
- **Dual-platform video strategy**: YouTube for outreach + Odysee for decentralized ethos
- **hCaptcha integration**: Traditional faucet UX + additional revenue stream
- **Simplified development**: No complex video puzzles, just expected captcha

## Features

- **Free Useless Tokens** dispensed to users for engagement
- **Gamification system** with achievements and leaderboards
- **Democratic charity voting** - tokens = voting power for revenue allocation
- **Context-aware humor content** - funny GIFs and images based on user state
- **Dual-platform video strategy** - YouTube for reach + Odysee for decentralization
- **hCaptcha revenue stream** - traditional faucet UX + paid per solve
- **Timer-based claims** with patience-themed humor during cooldown
- **Admin dashboard** for faucet management
- **API endpoints** for integration with main platform
- **Responsive design** for mobile and desktop
- **Viral charity impact** - shareable stories of collective charitable impact

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js/Express or PHP (TBD)
- **Database**: MySQL/PostgreSQL for user accounts and token balances
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (responsive design)
- **Token System**: Database-backed Useless Token management
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment

## üí∞ **hCaptcha Revenue Model**

### Why hCaptcha is Perfect for Charitable Faucets

hCaptcha transforms the traditional "anti-bot" security step into a genuine revenue generator for charity:

**üíµ Direct Revenue Generation:**
- Website owners earn $0.0001 to $0.001 per CAPTCHA solved
- Revenue scales automatically with user engagement
- Creates sustainable, predictable funding for charity projects
- No dependency on external donations or advertising

**üéØ Mission Alignment:**
- Every puzzle solved literally generates money for charity
- Users can be honestly told "solving this helps fund charity"
- Transforms security requirement into charitable action
- Higher platform traffic = more charity funding

**üìà Sustainable Growth:**
- Revenue grows naturally with platform popularity
- Creates positive feedback loop: better platform ‚Üí more users ‚Üí more charity funding
- Transparent funding model users can understand and support
- Incentivizes platform improvement and user retention

**üîß Implementation Details:**
- **Site Key**: `10000000-ffff-ffff-ffff-000000000001` (test key)
- **Secret Key**: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` (test key)
- **Production**: Requires real hCaptcha account for revenue generation
- **Integration**: Frontend widget + backend verification
- **Revenue Tracking**: Monitor earnings for transparent charity allocation

**‚ö†Ô∏è Development Safety Guidelines:**
- **Testing with Real Keys**: Only test real hCaptcha keys once to verify integration
- **Development Mode**: Use test tokens (`test_token_*`) for ongoing development
- **Avoid Localhost Abuse**: Extended testing on localhost may flag unusual activity
- **Production Deployment**: Only use real keys continuously on live domains
- **Safe Switching**: Backend accepts both real tokens and test tokens during development
