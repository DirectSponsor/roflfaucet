# Multi-Step Faucet Implementation - July 14, 2025

## Overview
Converted the single-page faucet to a traditional multi-step faucet process to increase page views and create more space for advertisements while maintaining the compact, no-scrolling experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. HTML Structure (index.html)
- **Replaced single faucet section** with three distinct steps:
  - `welcome-step`: Welcome screen with balance and claim button
  - `faucet-step`: Captcha and claim process
  - `result-step`: Success screen with results

### 2. JavaScript Implementation (simple-faucet.js)
- **Completely rewrote** the SimpleFaucet class for multi-step flow
- **Added step navigation** with proper state management
- **Implemented cooldown checking** before allowing progression to step 2
- **Added dynamic content updates** for logged-in vs demo users

## Three-Step Flow

### Step 1: Welcome Screen
- **Title**: "ROFLFaucet"
- **Subtitle**: "Claim some useless coins" 
- **Balance Display**: Shows current balance (real or demo)
- **Login Notice**: For non-logged-in users explaining demo mode
- **Welcome Message**: For logged-in users
- **Action**: "Start Claim Process" button

### Step 2: Claim Process
- **Title**: "Claim Your Reward"
- **Description**: Shows amount and type (UselessCoins or Demo Coins)
- **hCaptcha**: Validation step
- **Action**: "Claim X Coins" button

### Step 3: Success Result
- **Title**: "Congratulations!"
- **Result Display**: Shows won amount and type
- **Actions**: 
  - "Back to Faucet" button
  - "Play Slots" button
- **Token Integration**: Guest claims add 10 tokens to unified balance system

## Key Features

### Dynamic Content
- **Logged-in users**: Get real UselessCoins ("Coins" terminology)
- **Anonymous users**: Get Demo Tokens ("Tokens" terminology)
- **All labels update** based on authentication status
- **Unified Balance**: Guest tokens stored in `roflfaucet_demo_state` for cross-game use

### Cooldown System
- **5-minute cooldown** enforced before allowing claim process
- **Warning message** shows remaining time if user tries too early

### Authentication Integration
- **JWT login** system maintained from previous implementation
- **Seamless auth flow** with DirectSponsor OAuth
- **Proper logout** handling

## Testing Status

### Local Testing
- ✅ **Multi-step navigation** works correctly
- ✅ **Authentication states** properly handled
- ✅ **Balance tracking** for both real and demo coins
- ⚠️ **Captcha validation** bypassed (expected for local testing)

### Next Steps for Completion
1. **Add proper hCaptcha validation** for production
2. **Test on live site** to ensure captcha works
3. **Verify responsive behavior** on mobile devices
4. **Add CSS styling** for better visual separation between steps
5. **Consider adding animations** between step transitions

## Files Modified
- `index.html` - Complete restructure of main content area
- `simple-faucet.js` - Complete rewrite for multi-step flow
- `faucet-bridge.js` - Unified token system integration
- Connected to unified demo balance system (`roflfaucet_demo_state`)

## Benefits Achieved
- ✅ **More page views** (3 steps instead of 1)
- ✅ **Better ad placement** opportunities between steps
- ✅ **Traditional faucet experience** users expect
- ✅ **Compact design** maintained (no scrolling required)
- ✅ **Authentication system** preserved and working
- ✅ **Unified token system** for seamless cross-game experience
- ✅ **Guest token persistence** across faucet and games

## Known Issues
- Captcha validation currently bypassed (placeholder implementation)
- Need to test final deployment to ensure all functionality works on live site

**Status**: Multi-step flow implemented and working locally
**Next Session**: Add captcha validation and deploy to live site
