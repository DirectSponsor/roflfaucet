## Technical Implementation

### File Structure
```
/slots.html         # Main slot machine page
/slots.css          # Complete styling and animations
/slots.js           # Game engine and dual-mode logic
/images/bigwin*.png # Win celebration graphics
/faucet-bridge.js   # Unified token system integration
```

### Token System Integration
- **Unified Balance**: Uses `roflfaucet_demo_state` for guest users
- **Cross-Game Tokens**: Balance persists across faucet and all games
- **Seamless Flow**: Users claim from faucet, play in games
- **Login Integration**: JWT tokens for real balance API calls

### API Integration

**Required Endpoints:**

```javascript
// Get current user balance and level
GET /api/user/balance
Response: {
  spendableBalance: number,
  level: number,
  lifetimeBalance: number
}

// Add credits with transaction tracking
POST /api/user/balance/add
Body: {
  amount: number,
  source: "gaming_temp" | "daily_gaming_bonus",
  description: string
}

// Deduct credits with transaction tracking  
POST /api/user/balance/subtract
Body: {
  amount: number,
  source: "gaming_temp",
  description: string
}
```

### Transaction System

**Gaming Transactions:**
- `gaming_temp`: Real-time wins/losses during gameplay
- `daily_gaming_bonus`: End-of-day net positive rollup

**Daily Rollup Process:**
1. Calculate net gaming gain/loss for each user
2. If net positive: Add to lifetime balance as `daily_gaming_bonus`
3. If net negative: No lifetime balance change
4. Clear all `gaming_temp` transactions

## User Experience Flow

### Anonymous Users
1. **Discover**: Land on slots page, see exciting demo gameplay
2. **Engage**: Play with demo credits from unified balance system
3. **Claim More**: Directed to faucet when balance runs low
4. **Convert**: See login prompts after big wins
5. **Sign Up**: Create account to keep winnings

**Demo Token System:**
- Uses unified `roflfaucet_demo_state` localStorage key
- Starts with 0 credits, user claims from faucet
- Cross-game balance shared with faucet and future games
- 10 tokens per faucet claim for engaging gameplay

### Logged-In Users  
1. **Play**: Use real UselessCoins for gameplay
2. **Win**: Credits immediately added to spendable balance
3. **Progress**: Buy level upgrades for better multipliers
4. **Track**: Gaming activity separated from other earnings

## Economic Design

### Payout Structure
```javascript
Triple Matches:
🔴🔴🔴: 400x bet  // Jackpot
📊📊📊: 75x bet   // Triple BARs  
🍒🍒🍒: 35x bet   // Triple Cherries
🍌🍌🍌: 15x bet   // Triple Bananas
🍉🍉🍉: 12x bet   // Triple Watermelons
🍊🍊🍊: 10x bet   // Triple Oranges

Partial Matches:
🔴🍒_: 15x bet    // 7 + Cherry + Any
🍒🍒_: 8x bet     // Two Cherries + Any
🍒__: 5x bet      // One Cherry + Any
// ... additional partial matches
```

### Symbol Weights (Player-Favored)
- Cherry: 35% (most common, frequent small wins)
- Banana: 25% 
- Watermelon: 20%
- Orange: 15%
- Lucky 7: 3% (rare jackpot)
- BAR: 2% (rarest high value)

### Big Win System
- **Pool Building**: 10% of all bets contribute
- **Trigger Conditions**: Pool ≥ 1000 credits + 10+ spins + 2% random chance
- **Payout**: 80% of pool (keeps 20% for next big win)

## Configuration & Customization

### Symbol Configuration
```javascript
this.symbols = [
  { emoji: '🍒', name: 'cherry', value: 35, weight: 35 },
  // ... customize symbols, values, and weights
];
```

### Payout Adjustment
```javascript
this.payouts = {
  '🔴🔴🔴': 400,  // Adjust payout multipliers
  // ... modify winning combinations
};
```

### Level System Tuning
```javascript
this.levels = {
  1: { cost: 0, multiplier: 1.0, maxBet: 1 },
  // ... adjust costs and multipliers
};
```

## Security Considerations

### Client-Side Validation
- All game logic runs client-side for performance
- Server validates all balance changes
- Transaction types prevent gaming system abuse

### Anti-Cheat Measures
- Real balance managed server-side
- Demo mode uses client-side localStorage (acceptable for demo)
- API authentication required for real transactions
- Unified demo balance prevents token duplication across games

### Rate Limiting
- Consider implementing spin rate limits
- Monitor for unusual transaction patterns
- Validate bet amounts against user level

## Analytics & Monitoring

### Key Metrics
- **Conversion Rate**: Demo → Registered users
- **Engagement**: Average spins per session
- **Economics**: Win/loss ratios and pool dynamics
- **Progression**: Level advancement patterns

### Data Collection
```javascript
// Available statistics
this.totalSpins    // Total games played
this.totalWagered  // Total credits bet
this.totalWon      // Total credits won
this.bigWinPool    // Current jackpot size
```

## ⚖️ Odds Configuration System

### Current Implementation (July 2025)

The slot machine uses **separate virtual reel lists** for each reel, allowing fine-tuned odds control without adding new symbols. This approach provides asymmetric probability adjustments for optimal game balance.

### Separate Reel Configuration

**Each reel has 43 entries total with different distributions:**

#### Reel 1 (Left) - "Seven Starter"
```javascript
// Optimized for seven starts to increase medium wins
Watermelon: 6 entries (3+3) = 14.0%
Banana: 8 entries (5+3) = 18.6%
Cherries: 6 entries (4+2) = 14.0%
Seven: 4 entries (3+1) = 9.3% ← INCREASED
Bar: 1 entry = 2.3%
Bigwin: 2 entries = 4.7%
Blanks: 6 entries = 14.0%
```

#### Reel 2 (Middle) - "Bar Booster"
```javascript
// Enhanced bar frequency for middle position wins
Watermelon: 7 entries (4+3) = 16.3%
Banana: 7 entries (4+3) = 16.3% ← REDUCED
Cherries: 6 entries (4+2) = 14.0%
Seven: 3 entries (2+1) = 7.0%
Bar: 2 entries = 4.7% ← INCREASED
Bigwin: 2 entries = 4.7%
Blanks: 6 entries = 14.0%
```

#### Reel 3 (Right) - "Seven Finisher"
```javascript
// More sevens for completing seven combinations
Watermelon: 7 entries (4+3) = 16.3%
Banana: 8 entries (5+3) = 18.6%
Cherries: 5 entries (3+2) = 11.6% ← REDUCED
Seven: 4 entries (2+2) = 9.3% ← INCREASED
Bar: 1 entry = 2.3%
Bigwin: 2 entries = 4.7%
Blanks: 6 entries = 14.0%
```

### Calculated Win Probabilities

#### Three-of-a-Kind Odds
- **Three Watermelons**: 14.0% × 16.3% × 16.3% = **0.37%** → Pays 8x
- **Three Bananas**: 18.6% × 16.3% × 18.6% = **0.56%** → Pays 10x
- **Three Cherries**: 14.0% × 14.0% × 11.6% = **0.23%** → Pays 12x
- **Three Sevens**: 9.3% × 7.0% × 9.3% = **0.06%** → Pays 35x
- **Three Bars**: 2.3% × 4.7% × 2.3% = **0.002%** → Pays 75x
- **Three Bigwins**: 4.7% × 4.7% × 4.7% = **0.010%** → Pays 400x
- **Three Blanks**: 14.0% × 14.0% × 14.0% = **0.27%** → Pays 2x (hidden)

#### Special Combinations
- **Melon-Banana Combo**: (14.0%+18.6%) × (14.0%+7.0%) × (2.3%+4.7%) = **32.6% × 21.0% × 7.0% = 0.48%** → Pays 15x
- **Any Fruit Mix**: Approx **2-3%** → Pays 5x

### Balance Adjustments Made

**July 23, 2025 Changes:**
1. **Reduced fruit dominance**: Removed 3 fruit symbols total
2. **Increased medium wins**: Added 2 sevens and 1 bar
3. **Asymmetric distribution**: Each reel optimized for different outcomes
4. **Maintained blank ratio**: 6/43 (14%) to prevent boredom

**Impact:**
- Reduced low-value wins (8x-12x payouts)
- Increased medium-value wins (35x-75x payouts)
- Better game flow and engagement
- More strategic reel stopping patterns

### Odds Tuning Guidelines

#### Adding More Symbols
```javascript
// To reduce payouts: Add more blanks (max ~16/43 before boring)
// To increase medium wins: Add sevens/bars to strategic reels
// To reduce fruit dominance: Remove watermelon/banana entries
```

#### Asymmetric Strategies
```javascript
// Reel 1: High seven → Better seven starts
// Reel 2: High bar → More middle bars for combinations
// Reel 3: High seven → Better seven completions
// Keep bigwins rare but achievable (~2 entries per reel)
```

#### Testing Metrics
- **Target**: ~41 blanks per 60 spins (68% win rate)
- **Current**: ~14% blank per reel = ~2.7% three blanks
- **Spin counter**: Track actual performance in-game

### Configuration Management

**File Location**: `slots/slots.js` lines 109-180

**Easy Adjustments**:
1. Modify entry counts in `virtualReelList1/2/3`
2. Keep total at 43 entries per reel
3. Test with spin counter for balance verification
4. Update this documentation with changes

**Future Considerations**:
- Consider 50+ entries per reel for finer control
- Add rare "super bonus" symbols for special events
- Implement seasonal symbol variations
- Add progressive jackpot integration
