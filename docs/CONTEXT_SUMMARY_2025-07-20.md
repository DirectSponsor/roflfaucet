## Session Overview

**Focus**: Countdown Timer Standardization & UI Component Consistency  
**Status**: Complete - All countdown timers now working properly across the site

## Major Changes Completed

### 1. Countdown Timer System Standardization ‚úÖ

#### Problem Identified:
- Countdown buttons were inconsistently implemented across pages
- Some buttons missing required `id="faucet-countdown-btn"` for JavaScript integration
- Slots page countdown timer was not working due to missing proper button structure

#### Solution Implemented:
- **Standardized Include File**: All countdown buttons now use `includes/faucet-countdown-button.html`
- **Consistent Structure**: All buttons have proper ID attributes and include wrapper comments
- **JavaScript Integration**: All timers now properly connect to `site-utils.js` countdown functionality

#### Files Updated:

**Main Faucet Page (`index.html`)**:
- Replaced inline countdown button with standardized include structure
- Added proper include comments for maintainability

**Congratulations Page (`faucet-result.html`)**:
- Added countdown timer section with explanatory text: "Next claim available in:"
- Allows users to see when their next faucet claim will be available
- Changed navigation button text from "‚Üê Try Again" to "‚Üê Back to Faucet" for clarity

**Slots Page (`slots.html`)**:
- Fixed both front and back side countdown buttons
- Front button: `id="faucet-countdown-btn"`
- Back button: `id="faucet-countdown-btn-back"` 
- Both now properly integrate with JavaScript countdown system

### 2. User Experience Improvements ‚úÖ

#### Enhanced Flow:

<button id="faucet-countdown-btn" class="faucet-countdown-btn" onclick="handleFaucetClaim()" disabled>
    <span class="btn-text">Faucet: 300</span>
</button>
<!-- include end faucet-countdown-button.html -->
```

#### JavaScript Integration:
