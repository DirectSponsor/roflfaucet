### File Structure ✅ REORGANIZED
```
/includes/           - Shared HTML components
  ├── doctype-head.html
  ├── header.html
  ├── sidebar-left.html
  ├── sidebar-right.html
  └── footer.html

/templates/          - Page templates
  └── basic-page.tmpl - Master template for new pages

/docs/               - All project documentation (moved from root)
/archived-pages/     - Old versions and unused files
/backups/            - Build script backups (*.html.bak)

/*.html              - Main pages (built from includes)
/*.js, *.css, *.php  - Active project files only
```

```
