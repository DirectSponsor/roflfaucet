# ROFLFaucet Project Status - July 22, 2025

## Project Overview

### ðŸš€ Ad Rotation System Plan

Below is a plan for integrating an ad rotation system using your simplified line-based approach:

- **Ad Text Files**: Organize ads by importance for the page layout.
  - `high_importance_ads.txt` - Important slots (e.g., header)
  - `medium_importance_ads.txt` - Medium slots (e.g., sidebar)
  - `low_importance_ads.txt` - Less important slots (e.g., footer)

- **Ranking System**:
  - **Importance:** Determines ad slot placement (1-100)
  - **Frequency:** How often ads rotate in the slot (1-100)

- **Example Entry**:
```
<a href="https://advertiser.com"><img src="https://banner.jpg" alt="Ad"></a>
```

- **JavaScript Configuration**:

```javascript
this.adSlots = {
  header: {
      file: 'high_importance_ads.txt',
      importance: 80-100,
      frequency: 'every 30 seconds'
  },
  sidebar: {
      file: 'medium_importance_ads.txt', 
      importance: 40-79,
      frequency: 'every 60 seconds'
  },
  footer: {
      file: 'low_importance_ads.txt',
      importance: 1-39, 
      frequency: 'every 120 seconds'
  }
};
```

- **Benefits**:
  - Flexible and easy management
  - Gradually scale up by adding more text files
  - Update ads by editing text files like images

This plan ensures straightforward ad management and gradual scalability without complexity.
A responsive web-based slot machine game ("ROFLFaucet") with integrated advertising system and cryptocurrency faucet functionality.

## Current State Summary
- **Platform**: Linux Mint development environment
- **Location**: `/home/andy/Documents/websites/Warp/projects/rofl/roflfaucet/`
- **Deployment**: DDNS at `satoshihost.ddns.net`
- **Local Storage**: Browser persistence working for user balances

## Recent Development Progress

### 1. Responsive Design Improvements âœ…
- **Reel Sizing**: Adjusted from 150px â†’ 110px (desktop) â†’ 60px min (mobile)
- **Container Optimization**: Used `width: fit-content` to eliminate wasted background space
- **Mobile Navigation**: Added hamburger menu with overlay for screens <768px
- **Viewport Optimization**: Multiple breakpoints (320px-1200px+) for various devices

### 2. Header & UI Compactness âœ…
- **Mobile Space Saving**:
  - Hidden emojis (ðŸŽ°, ðŸ¤£) on mobile screens
  - Removed "Play slots and win coins" description
  - Converted "ROFLFaucet" to lowercase for width reduction
- **Navigation**: Hamburger menu implementation with proper show/hide logic

### 3. Sidebar & Layout Balance âœ…
- **Sidebar Width**: Increased from 22% to 25% (matches 300px ad standard)
- **Measurement Tools**: Installed `gruler` pixel ruler for precise layout work
- **Responsive Testing**: Verified on iPhone SE (320px) and other common viewports

### 4. Control Panel Optimization âœ…
- **Compact Design**: Reduced padding, borders, and column widths for mobile
- **Progressive Scaling**: Multiple breakpoints for graceful degradation

### 5. UI Spacing Alignment (July 22) âœ…
- **Header Spacing**: Reduced margin-bottom from 1rem to 0.5em for visual consistency
- **Layout Harmony**: Header-to-content gap now matches inter-column spacing (0.5em)
- **Professional Polish**: Achieved uniform spacing rhythm across all pages
- **Design System**: Consistent spacing values maintain visual hierarchy

## Current Technical Issues

### 1. Mobile Center Column Centering Issue ðŸ”´ **URGENT - July 26, 2025**
- **Issue**: When left sidebar collapses at 650px, the iframe shifts to the left instead of centering
- **Problem**: Main content area has margins/padding that prevent proper centering when sidebar stacks
- **Current State**: Iframe appears left-aligned with wasted space on the right
- **Root Cause**: Flexbox layout with margin/padding interactions not accounting for sidebar collapse
- **Impact**: Poor visual appearance on mobile/tablet when transitioning from desktop layout
- **Attempted Fixes (July 26)**:
  - âœ— Modified `.main-content` margins from `margin: 0` to `margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0` 
  - âœ— Removed left/right padding: `padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0`
  - âœ— Added visual debugging outlines (red for main-content, blue for iframe container)
  - **Result**: No change in behavior - iframe still appears left-aligned on mobile
  - **Observation**: The red/blue outlines were visible, confirming CSS was loading, but layout unchanged

### 2. Mobile Header Spacing Issue ðŸ”´ **Secondary Priority - July 25, 2025**
- **Issue**: Header has excessive spacing between elements on mobile devices (iPhone SE 375px width)
- **Problem**: `justify-content: space-between` creates huge gaps when navigation is hidden on mobile
- **Current State**: Logo on left, huge gap, then hamburger+login on right
- **Root Cause**: Header layout not optimized for mobile - need proper element grouping
- **Impact**: Causes horizontal scrolling and poor user experience on mobile
- **Next Steps**: 
  - Need to group hamburger menu and login button together on right side
  - Reduce overall header padding on mobile
  - Test that slots machine doesn't resize/reload after changes
- **Note**: Previous attempts today caused slots to load large then resize - need careful approach

### 2. Image Loading Problem ðŸ”´
- **Issue**: Test image loads locally but not on DDNS deployment
- **URL**: `http://satoshihost.ddns.net/home/andy/Documents/websites/-%20archived_sites/directsponsor/directsponsor.net/bloukrans.directsponsor.net/static/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_1293-300x224.jpg`
- **Suspected Cause**: Path outside domain scope or server configuration
- **Next Steps**: Need proper image hosting solution

### 2. Advertising System Setup ðŸ”¶
- **Status**: Ready to implement with proper image sources
- **Plan**: Create free image site playlists for ad content
- **Integration**: Sidebar ad system (300px width standard)

## Immediate Next Steps

### A. Image & Ad System (Priority 1)
1. **Set up proper image hosting** for ad content
2. **Create image playlists** from free sources
3. **Test ad loading** in sidebar system
4. **Implement rotating/dynamic ads**

### B. Animation Integration (Priority 2)
1. **Laughing animations**: Integrate animal/cartoon character animations
2. **Dynamic embedding**: Different animation each time
3. **Performance optimization**: Ensure smooth playback

### C. Deployment & Testing (Priority 3)
1. **Resolve DDNS image paths**
2. **Cross-browser testing**
3. **Performance optimization**
4. **Mobile device testing**
