Is this too unruly for you? Try the government faucet instead!

an alternative to roflfaucet, copy the faucet then adapt it to be a non-working faucet that keeps you waiting, is badly implemented, and barks orders at you. It can tell you resons why it is not working, e.g. cost overruns. It can use jargon instead of directly saying what it's for. 

we can use the "government" memes in the pictures folder. The sidebars remain the same. 

It can give you things you don't want and then demand that you pay for them anyway. E.g. It can show you a quote and then demand payment. 

It can look at your balance and demand tax, and threaten you with fines and imprisonment if you don't pay. E.g. check balance, then pop up a demand for xx coins/tokens. No thanks produces the longer warning, with a promise that evaders always get caught. 

----- here is a quote that could go with an appropriate image
"You compare the nation, perhaps, to a parched tract of land, and the tax to a fertilizing rain. Be it so. But you ought also to ask yourself where are the sources of this rain and whether it is not the tax itself which draws away the moisture from the ground and dries it up?"
- Frederic Bastiat - That Which is Seen, and That Which is Not Seen, 1850
