# Wheel of Wealth Implementation Log

## Problem Statement
The wheel game needs to synchronize visual wheel rotation with game outcomes. The wheel has 24 segments at 15° intervals, with an arrow pointing at 270° (9 o'clock position).

## Wheel Structure (from wheel.txt)
- 24 segments, 15° each
- Arrow at 270° position
- Starting from arrow (position 0): 2X, LOSE, 50X, 4X, 3X, LOSE, REFUND, 2X, 5X, LOSE, 3X, 20X, LOSE, 5X, 6X, LOSE, 3X, 4X, 2X, 2X, 3X, 3X, 4X, LOSE

## Embedded Outcomes Distribution (100 total)
- LOSE: 84 outcomes
- 2X: 5 outcomes  
- 3X: 4 outcomes
- 4X: 2 outcomes
- 5X: 3 outcomes
- 6X: 1 outcome
- REFUND: 1 outcome
- 20X: 1 outcome
- 50X: 1 outcome

## Implementation Approaches Tried

### Approach 1: Predetermined Angle Mapping (FAILED)
- Tried to map outcomes to specific angles and force wheel to land there
- Issues: Visual wheel didn't respect forced angles, outcome selection didn't match visuals

### Approach 2: Angle-to-Outcome Lookup (CURRENT - HAS ISSUE)
- Maps each 15° segment to its outcome from wheel.txt
- Generates random rotation, calculates final position, looks up outcome
- **PROBLEM**: This gives equal probability to each wheel segment, but the embedded outcomes list has 84 LOSE vs only 1 50X. The wheel segments don't reflect the intended probability distribution.

## User's Suggested Approach (TO IMPLEMENT)
1. Generate random spin amount (multiple rotations + extra degrees)
2. Let wheel spin that amount visually
3. Calculate final angle position (totalRotation % 360)
4. Use the embedded outcomes list to determine result:
   - Pick random index from 100 outcomes
   - Display that outcome regardless of visual position
5. OR: Create a 360-degree lookup table that respects the probability distribution

## Key Insight
The wheel segments (24 physical positions) and the outcome probabilities (100 weighted outcomes) are separate concepts that need to be reconciled.

## Implementation History

### Approach 3: Direct Angle Calculation (CURRENT)
**Status**: Just implemented - testing needed

**Key Changes Made**:
1. **Removed animation reset bug**: The `animateWheelSpin` function was resetting wheel to 0° before each spin, breaking position tracking. Fixed by removing the reset.

2. **Simplified rotation calculation**: 
   - Select target segment from weighted list
   - Calculate direct rotation: `(targetSegment.angle - this.currentRotation + 360) % 360`
   - Add 2-4 full rotations for visual effect
   - Update currentRotation for next spin

3. **Fixed position tracking**: 
   - `this.currentRotation` now properly tracks wheel position between spins
   - No more resetting to 0°, maintains continuity

4. **Accurate rotation mechanics confirmed**: 
   - Tested with exact 360° multiples - wheel returns to same position
   - Math calculations are correct
   - Animation follows rotation commands accurately

**Current Logic Flow**:
1. Select random segment from weighted list (respects 84% LOSE probability)
2. Calculate needed rotation to reach that segment
3. Add extra full rotations for visual effect
4. Animate wheel to new absolute position
5. Track final position for next spin

**Issue**: There's still a bug in the animation call - `animateWheelSpin(totalRotation)` should receive the absolute final angle, not the additional rotation amount.

- `/home/andy/warp/projects/roflfaucet/wheel/WHEEL_IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md` - This documentation

**Testing Notes**:
- User reported wheel still not aligning with outcomes
- Console shows calculations are correct
- May need to fix absolute vs relative rotation in animation

### Approach 4: Arrow Position Fix (BREAKTHROUGH - July 29, 2025)
**Status**: MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH - Root cause identified and fixed!

**Problem Discovered**: 
- Manual testing with individual rotation amounts (90°, 180°, 15°, 380°, 345°) revealed no drift in rotation logic
- However, expected outcomes didn't match visual wheel results
- Pattern analysis showed consistent 90° offset: expected outcome was always what appeared at TOP of wheel, not at arrow

**Root Cause**: 
- Arrow position at 270° (9 o'clock) was not being accounted for in outcome calculations
- Code was calculating what segment should be at wheel's logical position, not what segment the arrow points to
- When wheel rotates clockwise by X°, arrow points to (270° - X°) on wheel's coordinate system

**Key Fix Applied**:
```javascript
// OLD: Check logical position directly
const expectedSegment = this.findSegmentAtAngle(this.logicalPosition);

// NEW: Calculate what arrow points to
const arrowPosition = (270 - this.logicalPosition + 360) % 360;
const expectedSegment = this.findSegmentAtAngle(arrowPosition);
```

**Breakthrough Insight**: 
- Separated CSS animation position (`totalRotation`) from logical wheel position (`logicalPosition`)
- CSS position can grow indefinitely for smooth animations
- Logical position stays 0-359° for game calculations
- Arrow calculation now correctly accounts for 270° offset

**Validation Results**:
- Manual 90° rotations now show perfect alignment between expected and actual outcomes
- No drift detected over 15+ consecutive spins
- Pattern matching confirmed: visual wheel matches calculated results exactly

**Files Modified**:
- `/home/andy/warp/projects/roflfaucet/wheel/wheel.js` - Fixed arrow position calculation
- `/home/andy/warp/projects/roflfaucet/wheel/WHEEL_IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md` - This documentation

**Next Steps**: 
- Implement actual game logic using corrected arrow position calculation
- Replace manual test rotations with random outcome selection + target angle calculation
- Add full rotations for visual spinning effect
- Test with complete game flow including balance updates
