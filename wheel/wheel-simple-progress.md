# Wheel Simple System - Progress Log

**Date Started:** July 29, 2025  
**Approach:** Incremental, simplified system  
**Files:** `wheel-simple.js`, `wheel-simple.css`

## Summary

After multiple attempts with complex 360-degree systems that had CSS/JS conflicts and range calculation issues, we're starting fresh with the simplest possible approach:

- **24 segments only** (0-23) matching physical wheel
- **Center-point targeting** (0¬∞, 15¬∞, 30¬∞, etc.) - no ranges
- **New JS + new CSS** - no conflicts with old system
- **Incremental building** - test each part before adding complexity

## The Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Structure ‚úÖ
- [x] Create `wheel-simple.js` with 24-segment array
- [x] Create `wheel-simple.css` with minimal styling
- [x] Update `wheel.html` to use new files
- [ ] Test basic rotation to segment centers

### Phase 2: Core Rotation ‚úÖ
- [x] Implement `spinToSegment(segmentNumber)` function
- [x] Test manual rotations (0, 1, 2, 3 for quarters)
- [x] **FIXED:** Visual alignment matches expected results
- [x] Ensure forward-only spinning with full rotations

### Phase 3: Random Selection üîÑ IN PROGRESS
- [x] Expanded from 4 to 8 segments (every 45¬∞)
- [x] Added varied outcomes: 3X, 4X, 5X, JACKPOT
- [x] Updated test functions (testEights(), testSegment(0-7))
- [ ] **ISSUE FOUND:** Slight alignment offset - hits adjacent segments sometimes
- [ ] **ANALYSIS NEEDED:** Wheel appears to be 24-segment, not 8-segment image
- [ ] Test multiple random spins
- [ ] Verify no drift or alignment issues

### Phase 4: Probability Weighting ‚è≥
- [ ] Add weighted probability list
- [ ] Implement proper game odds
- [ ] Test probability distribution

### Phase 5: Game Integration ‚è≥
- [ ] Add balance system integration
- [ ] Add payout calculations
- [ ] Add win/loss display
- [ ] Final testing

## Current Status: Phase 3 In Progress - 8 Segments Added, Minor Alignment Issue Found ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Key Decisions Made:
- **Segments:** 0-23 (24 total)
- **Targeting:** Center degrees only (segment * 15)
- **Files:** `wheel-simple.js` + `wheel-simple.css`
- **Approach:** Build incrementally, test each phase

### Working System Reference:
- Last working commit: `b77b1b4` (all tests passed)
- Backup files preserved: `wheel-clean.js.backup`
- Known issue: CSS/JS transform conflicts

## Next Action:
Test the basic system:
1. Load the wheel page
2. Open browser console
3. Try `testSegment(0)` to test segment 0 (12 o'clock, 2X)
4. Try `testSegment(6)` to test segment 6 (3 o'clock, LOSE) 
5. Try `testSegment(12)` to test segment 12 (6 o'clock, 5X)
6. Try `testSegment(18)` to test segment 18 (9 o'clock, 2X) - arrow position

If quarter tests work correctly, move to Phase 2.

**Update Log:**
- 2025-07-29 16:32 - Initial documentation created, Phase 1 planning complete
- 2025-07-29 16:33 - Phase 1 files created: wheel-simple.js, wheel-simple.css, wheel.html updated
- 2025-07-29 18:43 - **BREAKTHROUGH:** Fixed script duplication in wheel.html (removed core scripts from SCRIPTS placeholder)
- 2025-07-29 18:43 - **PHASE 2 COMPLETE:** Visual alignment now matches system results perfectly!
  - Added debug display showing segment ID, target angle, and outcome
  - Simplified segment mapping to direct degree-to-outcome mapping
  - Confirmed all 4 quarter positions work correctly:
    * 0¬∞ (12 o'clock) ‚Üí DOUBLE ‚úÖ
    * 90¬∞ (3 o'clock) ‚Üí DOUBLE ‚úÖ  
    * 180¬∞ (6 o'clock) ‚Üí LOSE ‚úÖ
    * 270¬∞ (9 o'clock) ‚Üí REFUND ‚úÖ
  - Removed arrow-based logic (not needed - just wheel rotation matters)
  - Ready for Phase 3: Random Selection
- 2025-07-29 19:04 - **PHASE 3 STARTED:** Expanded to 8 segments
  - Added segments 1, 3, 5, 7 with outcomes: 3X, 4X, 5X, JACKPOT
  - Updated test functions for 8-segment testing
  - **ISSUE DISCOVERED:** Slight alignment offset on some positions
    * Debug shows correct target degrees (45¬∞, 135¬∞, 225¬∞, 315¬∞)
    * Visual shows landing on adjacent segments (e.g., "LOSE TURN" instead of "5X")
    * Appears to be hitting center of segments correctly, but wrong segments
    * Wheel image appears to be 24-segment (15¬∞ each), not 8-segment
  - **NEXT ACTION:** Recalibrate degrees to match actual wheel image segments
  - **STATUS:** Paused for analysis - resume in ~1 hour
