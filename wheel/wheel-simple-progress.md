# Wheel Simple System - Progress Log

**Date Started:** July 29, 2025  
**Approach:** Incremental, simplified system  
**Files:** `wheel-simple.js`, `wheel-simple.css`

## Summary

After multiple attempts with complex 360-degree systems that had CSS/JS conflicts and range calculation issues, we're starting fresh with the simplest possible approach:

- **24 segments only** (0-23) matching physical wheel
- **Center-point targeting** (0¬∞, 15¬∞, 30¬∞, etc.) - no ranges
- **New JS + new CSS** - no conflicts with old system
- **Incremental building** - test each part before adding complexity

## The Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Structure ‚úÖ
- [x] Create `wheel-simple.js` with 24-segment array
- [x] Create `wheel-simple.css` with minimal styling
- [x] Update `wheel.html` to use new files
- [ ] Test basic rotation to segment centers

### Phase 2: Core Rotation ‚úÖ
- [x] Implement `spinToSegment(segmentNumber)` function
- [x] Test manual rotations (0, 1, 2, 3 for quarters)
- [x] **FIXED:** Visual alignment matches expected results
- [x] Ensure forward-only spinning with full rotations

### Phase 3: Random Selection üîÑ IN PROGRESS
- [x] Expanded from 4 to 8 segments (every 45¬∞)
- [x] Added varied outcomes: 3X, 4X, 5X, JACKPOT
- [x] Updated test functions (testEights(), testSegment(0-7))
- [ ] **ISSUE FOUND:** Slight alignment offset - hits adjacent segments sometimes
- [ ] **ANALYSIS NEEDED:** Wheel appears to be 24-segment, not 8-segment image
- [ ] Test multiple random spins
- [ ] Verify no drift or alignment issues

### Phase 4: Probability Weighting ‚è≥
- [ ] Add weighted probability list
- [ ] Implement proper game odds
- [ ] Test probability distribution

### Phase 5: Game Integration ‚è≥
- [ ] Add balance system integration
- [ ] Add payout calculations
- [ ] Add win/loss display
- [ ] Final testing

## Current Status: Phase 3 In Progress - 8 Segments Added, Minor Alignment Issue Found ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Key Decisions Made:
- **Segments:** 0-23 (24 total)
- **Targeting:** Center degrees only (segment * 15)
- **Files:** `wheel-simple.js` + `wheel-simple.css`
- **Approach:** Build incrementally, test each phase

### Working System Reference:
- Last working commit: `b77b1b4` (all tests passed)
- Backup files preserved: `wheel-clean.js.backup`
- Known issue: CSS/JS transform conflicts

## Next Action:
Test the basic system:
1. Load the wheel page
2. Open browser console
3. Try `testSegment(0)` to test segment 0 (12 o'clock, 2X)
4. Try `testSegment(6)` to test segment 6 (3 o'clock, LOSE) 
5. Try `testSegment(12)` to test segment 12 (6 o'clock, 5X)
6. Try `testSegment(18)` to test segment 18 (9 o'clock, 2X) - arrow position

If quarter tests work correctly, move to Phase 2.

    * 180¬∞ (6 o'clock) ‚Üí LOSE ‚úÖ
    * 270¬∞ (9 o'clock) ‚Üí REFUND ‚úÖ
  - Removed arrow-based logic (not needed - just wheel rotation matters)
  - Ready for Phase 3: Random Selection
- 2025-07-29 19:04 - **PHASE 3 STARTED:** Expanded to 8 segments
  - Added segments 1, 3, 5, 7 with outcomes: 3X, 4X, 5X, JACKPOT
  - Updated test functions for 8-segment testing
  - **ISSUE DISCOVERED:** Slight alignment offset on some positions
    * Debug shows correct target degrees (45¬∞, 135¬∞, 225¬∞, 315¬∞)
    * Visual shows landing on adjacent segments (e.g., "LOSE TURN" instead of "5X")
    * Appears to be hitting center of segments correctly, but wrong segments
    * Wheel image appears to be 24-segment (15¬∞ each), not 8-segment
  - **NEXT ACTION:** Recalibrate degrees to match actual wheel image segments
  - **STATUS:** Paused for analysis - resume in ~1 hour
- 2025-07-29 20:00 - **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED** üéØ
  - **Issue:** Phase 3 expansion used made-up outcomes instead of consulting wheel map
  - **Evidence:** Line 91 shows "Added segments 1, 3, 5, 7 with outcomes: 3X, 4X, 5X, JACKPOT"
  - **Reality Check:** Andy's testing showed these don't match actual wheel image
  - **Actual outcomes from wheel_segment_positions.txt:**
    * Segment 1 (45¬∞): LOSE (not 3X)
    * Segment 3 (135¬∞): 2X (not 4X) 
    * Segment 5 (225¬∞): 2X (not 5X)
    * Segment 7 (315¬∞): 4X (not JACKPOT)
  - **Solution:** Always reference `wheel_segment_positions.txt` for outcomes
  - **Lesson Learned:** Don't assume or make up outcomes - use authoritative wheel map

## üèóÔ∏è PROPER BUILD PROCESS (Established 2025-07-29)

### Golden Rule: Always Use Authoritative Data Sources 
**Primary Source:** `wheel_segment_positions.txt` - Contains the definitive 24-segment wheel map

### Step-by-Step Expansion Process:
1. **Start with working base** (4 quarters confirmed working)
2. **Check the map** - Look up actual outcome at target degree in `wheel_segment_positions.txt`
3. **Add ONE segment at a time** - Don't batch multiple changes
4. **Test immediately** - Verify both system result and visual alignment
5. **Document success** before moving to next segment

### Debugging Process:
1. **Visual mismatch?** ‚Üí Check if outcome matches `wheel_segment_positions.txt`
2. **System says X, wheel shows Y?** ‚Üí Verify degree calculation is correct
3. **Inconsistent results?** ‚Üí Look for CSS transform conflicts or rotation drift

### Reference Data Format:
```
Position X: Angle Y¬∞ ‚Üí OUTCOME
```

### Never Do:
- ‚ùå Assume outcomes based on patterns
- ‚ùå Make up "varied outcomes" for testing
- ‚ùå Batch multiple untested changes
- ‚ùå Skip verification steps

### Always Do:
- ‚úÖ Reference the authoritative wheel map
- ‚úÖ Test one change at a time
- ‚úÖ Verify visual alignment matches system result
- ‚úÖ Document successful configurations

## üéØ PURE ROTATION BREAKTHROUGH (2025-07-29 20:20)

### The Problem with Segment-Based Approach:
- JavaScript was trying to be "smart" about segments and outcomes
- It mapped segment IDs to outcomes internally
- This created alignment issues when wheel map data didn't match assumptions
- System was calculating target degrees itself instead of just rotating

### The Solution - Pure Rotation System:
**Simple Input/Output:**
- **Input:** `rotateWheel(degrees)` - degrees to rotate
- **Output:** Wheel rotates by exactly that amount
- **State:** Only tracks `currentPosition` (0-359¬∞)

**External Logic Handles Everything Else:**
- Game logic calculates how many degrees to spin
- Game logic knows what segment it's targeting
- Game logic handles payouts based on final position
- Wheel system is "dumb" - just rotates by the amount requested

### Architecture Benefits:
- ‚úÖ **No mapping conflicts** - wheel doesn't know about segments
- ‚úÖ **No alignment issues** - pure degree-based rotation
- ‚úÖ **Clean separation** - rotation logic separate from game logic
- ‚úÖ **Easy debugging** - can test exact degree rotations
- ‚úÖ **Reliable state** - only tracks wheel position, nothing else

### Core Function:
```javascript
rotateWheel(degrees) {
    // Rotate wheel by exact degrees requested
    // Update currentPosition state
    // Animate wheel rotation
    // No segment logic whatsoever
}
```

### Next Phase: External Game Logic
- Calculate target degrees from segment selection
- Handle outcome determination
- Manage payouts
- Call rotateWheel() with calculated degrees

## üî¨ MANUAL TESTING PHASE (2025-07-29 21:30)

### Current Issue:
- Game logic was removed to isolate wheel rotation testing
- Need to verify degree-to-outcome mapping is accurate
- Using manual testing to calibrate segment map

### Manual Testing Approach:
**Goal:** Test specific degrees and visually verify outcomes match the segment map

**Complete Testing Process:**
1. **Start Fresh:** Load new page (wheel at default 0¬∞)
2. **Generate Test Spin:**
   - Pick random number between 0-359¬∞ (target position)
   - Add multiple of 360¬∞ for full rotations (makes it interesting)
   - Total = `targetDegree + (fullRotations * 360)`
3. **Execute Spin:** Use `manualSpin(totalDegrees)`
4. **Calculate Final Position:** 
   - Final position = `totalDegrees % 360` (modulo operation - removes full rotations)
   - This gives us the actual wheel orientation (0-359¬∞)
5. **Verify Mapping:**
   - Look up the **original target degree** (0-359¬∞) in our segment map
   - Compare map prediction vs what we visually see on wheel
   - Document any mismatches
6. **Update State:** Final position becomes starting point for next test

**Key Insight:** The modulo operation (`%`) is what you were thinking of - it gives the remainder after removing all full 360¬∞ rotations.

### Test Results Log:
- ‚úÖ `manualSpin(194)` ‚Üí System: "LOSE", Visual: "LUCKY 20" ‚Üí **MISMATCH IDENTIFIED**
- ‚úÖ **Correction:** 194¬∞ should map to "LUCKY 20", not "LOSE"
- üîÑ **Status:** Manual testing approach working - can identify mapping errors

### Key Test Points to Verify:
- `manualSpin(194)` - Should show LUCKY 20 (was incorrectly mapped to LOSE)
- `manualSpin(0)` - Should show REFUND
- `manualSpin(75)` - Test where 20X should be
- `manualSpin(315)` - Test confirmed 4X position

### Workflow:
1. Run `manualSpin(X)` for specific degree
2. Compare console output (system prediction) vs visual result
3. Document mismatches
4. Update segment mapping based on visual verification
5. Re-test corrected positions

**Benefit:** This eliminates game logic as a variable and focuses purely on degree-to-outcome accuracy.
