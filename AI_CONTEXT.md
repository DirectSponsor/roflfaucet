## ðŸ¤– For AI Assistants Working on This Project

### Project Type
**ClickForCharity Ecosystem Project** - This means ALL development standards apply.

### Required Reading Before Making Changes
1. **[DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS.md](DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS.md)** - Complete development guidelines
2. **[PHILOSOPHY.md](PHILOSOPHY.md)** - Core principles and "Function Over Flash" philosophy

### Key Standards Summary
- **CSS Units**: Use `rem`/`em` instead of `px` for fonts and spacing
- **Layout**: Flexbox over CSS Grid for compatibility
- **Accessibility**: Target users with poor connections, lightweight browsers
- **Performance**: Every byte counts, optimize for global users
- **Philosophy**: Function over flash - enable access to real value, don't distract

### Development Workflow
1. **Check standards** before starting any CSS/HTML work
2. **Test in lightweight browsers** when possible
3. **Use relative units** for all scalable elements
4. **Keep it simple** - serve the mission, not the ego
