---

## 🎲 What Was Built

### 1. Complete Dice Game Implementation
- **File**: `dice.html` - Full HTML page with modern UI
- **File**: `css/dice.css` - Advanced CSS with glassmorphism effects  
- **File**: `js/dice-game.js` - Intelligent JavaScript with probability calculations

#### Key Features Implemented:
✅ **High/Low Strategy Toggle** - Players choose roll UNDER or OVER to win  
✅ **Dynamic Payout Multipliers** - 1.01x to 100x with real-time probability calculation  
✅ **Intelligent Probability System** - Formula: `winChance = (100 - houseEdge) / payoutMultiplier`  
✅ **Fair House Edge** - Only 0.5% (very player-friendly)  
✅ **Precise Roll Results** - 0.01 to 99.99 range with 2 decimal precision  
✅ **Game Statistics Tracking** - Total rolls, wagered, won, win rate  
✅ **Recent Rolls History** - Live feed of last 10 game results  
✅ **Sound Effects Integration** - Roll, win, lose audio feedback  
✅ **UnifiedBalanceSystem Integration** - Works with existing balance API  
✅ **JWT Authentication Support** - Login status detection and currency display  
✅ **Mobile Responsive Design** - Works on all screen sizes  

### 2. Navigation System Redesign
Updated all pages with new Games dropdown menu:

**Before**: `Faucet | Slots | Profile | About`  
**After**: `Faucet | Games ▼ | Profile | About`  

**Games Submenu**:
- 🎰 Slots
- 🎲 Roll of Chance (NEW)
- 🎡 Wheel of Wealth

#### Files Updated:
- `includes/header.html` - Added dropdown menu structure
- `styles/styles.css` - Added dropdown CSS with glassmorphism effects
- `wheel.html` - Updated navigation + added audio elements

### 3. Audio System Implementation
**Directory**: `sounds/`

**Files Created**:
- `dice-roll.wav/mp3` - Rattling dice sound effect
- `win.wav/mp3` - Victory celebration sound
- `lose.wav/mp3` - Defeat/loss sound  
- `wheel-spin.wav/mp3` - Spinning wheel whoosh sound

**Audio Integration**:

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Dice Game Logic Flow:
1. **User Input** → Bet amount + Payout multiplier selection
2. **Probability Calculation** → Real-time win chance display
3. **High/Low Toggle** → Strategy selection (roll under vs over)
4. **Roll Execution** → Balance deduction → API call → Result calculation
5. **Result Processing** → Win/lose determination → Payout → Stats update
6. **UI Updates** → Animation → Sound effects → Balance display

### Integration Points:
- **UnifiedBalanceSystem** - Balance management and API calls
- **JWT Authentication** - User login status and currency display
- **Flat-file API Backend** - User data storage and statistics
- **Template System** - Header/footer includes across all pages

## 🎮 Game Mechanics Deep Dive

### Probability Formula:
```javascript
const winChance = (100 - houseEdge) / payoutMultiplier;
```

### Examples:
- **2x payout** = 49.75% win chance (safe play)
- **10x payout** = 9.95% win chance (medium risk)  
- **50x payout** = 1.99% win chance (high risk)
- **100x payout** = 0.995% win chance (extreme risk)

### High/Low Strategy:
- **LOW Mode**: Roll UNDER threshold to win
- **HIGH Mode**: Roll OVER (100 - threshold) to win
- **Threshold**: Dynamically calculated based on payout multiplier

### Roll Result Determination:
```javascript
const rollResult = Math.random() * 99.98 + 0.01; // 0.01 to 99.99
const isWin = isLowMode ? 
    rollResult <= winChance : 
    rollResult >= (100 - winChance);
```

## 🔧 Technical Notes

### Browser Compatibility:
- **Audio**: WAV (universal) + MP3 (modern browsers)
- **CSS**: Modern features with fallbacks
- **JavaScript**: ES6+ with compatibility checks

### Performance Considerations:
- Audio files are preloaded but not auto-played (good for UX)
- CSS uses GPU acceleration for animations
- JavaScript uses efficient event delegation

### Security Notes:
- All user inputs are validated client and server-side
- Balance operations go through secure API endpoints
- JWT tokens are verified for authenticated operations
