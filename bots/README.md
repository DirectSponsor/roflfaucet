- **Passive Income** - Earn coins while away from computer (but tab stays open)
- **Customizable Strategy** - Set betting amounts, risk levels, game types
- **Session Persistence** - Works in background tabs, pauses when tab closes

#### For Site (ROFLFaucet):
- **Increased Session Duration** ⏰ - VIP members keep tabs open longer
- **More Ad Impressions** 📈 - Longer sessions = more ad revenue potential  
- **Premium Revenue** 💰 - $5/month subscription via BTC payments
- **User Engagement** 🎯 - Incentivizes staying connected to the site

### Technical Requirements
