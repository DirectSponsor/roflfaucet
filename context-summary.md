# ROFLFaucet Project - Context Summary

## Recent Fixes

1. **CORS Issues**: Resolved misconfigurations on the data server causing CORS errors, by fixing duplicate and wildcard headers in PHP and nginx configurations.

2. **Authentication Flow**: Verified that JWT tokens are properly issued, stored, and utilized, ensuring correct login/logout functionality.
   
3. **UI and Auth Integration**:
   - Corrected username extraction logic in the frontend.
   - Deployed fixes to production.

4. **Chat Server**:
   - Reconfigured the advanced chat server to use port 8081 with path `/chat`.
   - Removed the old WebSocket server (`websocket-server.js`) to prevent port conflicts.
   - Updated nginx to proxy `/ws` to http://localhost:8081/chat.
   - Verified the chat connection through the frontend is now stable.

## Current State

- **Chat**: Working on port 8081 with correct proxying. Connection successful but username not displayed.
- **Login/Authentication**: Functionality verified, but username needs further fix in the chat display.

## Recent Improvements:

1. **Enhanced Node.js Chat Server Reliability**:
   - Improved shutdown handling with better signal management and timeouts.
   - Graceful shutdown with forced closure if necessary.
   - Enhanced systemd configuration for better process management.
   - WebSocket connections are closed and managed correctly.

2. **Issue with shutdowns resolved**.

## Future Reference (PHP Option):

- Consider simple PHP polling system if further reliability improvements are ever needed. Integrates well with existing backend.

## Backups:
- WebSocket system is backed up in `backups/websocket-chat-system`.

## Latest Status (Session 3):

3. **Node.js Chat Server Reliability - RESOLVED**:
   - Implemented improved shutdown handling with proper signal management.
   - Enhanced systemd service configuration for better process management.
   - WebSocket connections now close gracefully without timeouts.
   - Service starts and stops reliably via systemctl.
   - Chat server is running stably on port 8081.

4. **PHP Polling Alternative Documented**:
   - Created comprehensive documentation in `docs/php-polling-chat-option.md`.
   - Fully mapped all features and implementation approach.
   - Available as future backup option if needed.

## Next Steps:

- **Username Display Testing**: Test authentication flow and username display in live chat.
- Monitor chat logs for authentication issues.
- Consider minor tweaks to testing mode if needed.
