## Project Overview

A satirical alternative faucet within ROFLFaucet that parodies government behavior through deliberately broken services, automatic charges, and bureaucratic harassment. Designed for users "uncomfortable with the anarchic nature of ROFLFaucet" who prefer authority-based systems.

## Core Features

### The Experience
- **Entry Fee**: Automatically charges users 1 coin upon visiting (even with 0 balance)
- **Instant Debt**: Can push users into negative balance - government debt from first contact
- **Incognito Safe**: Users can explore the satire in incognito mode without risking real balance
- **Marketing**: Link text example: "🏛️ Prefer Authority? Try Our Government Faucet! (Psst: incognito users explore safely)"
- **False Promises**: Offers "refunds" via impossible-to-meet conditions in legalese
- **Unwanted Services**: Provides "services" you don't want and bills you for them anyway
- **Broken Faucet**: Mimics normal faucet process but everything malfunctions
- **Kafka-esque Journey**: 100% frustration with no successful outcomes
- **Perfect Tax System**: Only the tax payment works flawlessly (but fails to register)

### Visual Identity
- **Name**: "Federal Digital Asset Distribution Portal" or similar
- **Aesthetic**: Miserable and hostile government website circa 2003
- **Typography**: Times New Roman for authentic bureaucratic feel
- **Colors**: Dull government blues/grays
- **Branding**: 🏛️ or 📋 instead of 🤣

### Behavioral Patterns
- **Random Excuses**: Rotates government-style failure messages
- **Escalating Tax Demands**: Increases penalties when unpaid
- **Pop-up Harassment**: Official NOTICEs with ALL CAPS threats
- **Recursive Errors**: 404-style humor ("Search for 404 page also gave not found")

## Key Satirical Elements

### Government Behaviors Parodied
1. **Takes your money first, provides service never**
2. **Creates instant debt from first contact**
3. **Gives you things you don't want, bills you anyway**
4. **Only payment systems work perfectly**
5. **Escalating threats and penalties**
6. **Incomprehensible legal requirements**
7. **Services "temporarily unavailable" permanently**
8. **Bureaucratic jargon hiding simple failures**

### User Journey Philosophy
> "I don't remember any Kafka novels having good endings!"

- Entry through false promises
- Immediate unexplained charges
- Broken processes that seem fixable but aren't
- Perfect payment systems that don't solve problems
- Loop back to start with new "opportunities" to fail

## Original Inspiration Quote
> "You compare the nation, perhaps, to a parched tract of land, and the tax to a fertilizing rain. Be it so. But you ought also to ask yourself where are the sources of this rain and whether it is not the tax itself which draws away the moisture from the ground and dries it up?"
